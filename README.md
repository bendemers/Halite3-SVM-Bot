# Halite3-SVM-Bot
2018-19 Halite 3 Contest Bot from @twosigma

# My Bot
My goal for the project was to try and have the bot replicate the strategies of the top users, like running all ships into the shipyard at the end of the round and block others base from entry if they have safe moves on. Overall I enjoyed the experince of working with an existing framework and appyling my own ideas. 

# [Results](https://halite.io/user/?user_id=4561)
I was able to get my bot into the top 25% of overall users from all over the world. I was also in the top 500 high schoolers particiapting in the contest with an high bot score of 49.43 for my bot
